/**
 * Handle when a user starts typing in the mirror server or a source server.
 *
 * We forward typing in both directions: our typing in the mirror server goes
 * to the source server, and other people's typing in the source server goes to
 * the mirror server.
 *
 * If our handling were more complex here (e.g. if we were attaching names
 * to it or w/e), we would probably want to handle those cases separately.
 * For now though, we handle them together: typing just gets proxied
 * bi-directionally, and that's all there is to it!
